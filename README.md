# Project_BreastCancerWisconsin
Analysis of Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
This project intended to make a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using KNeighborsClassifier. The data was reviewed, cleaned, and processed to be used for training the learning model. After training the machine learning algorithm, it was evaluated on performance and each scoreâ€™s weighted average percent was high, precision was at 97%, recall at 97%, F1-Score at 97%, and accuracy at 97%. The analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin data helped show that machine learning can assist in breast cancer diagnosis. This model could be a great tool for assisting professionals with identifying cancer quickly to provide fast and accurate service as doctors care for their patients. 

**Data features list:**

<ins>Sample Code Number</ins> is the identifier for each sample of tissue. 

<ins>Clump Thickness</ins> is the thickness of cell clusters of the tumor. 

<ins>Uniformity of Cell Size</ins> is how much alike the cells are to each other in size in the tumor.  

<ins>Uniformity of Cell Shape</ins>  is how much alike the cells are to each other in shape. 

<ins>Marginal Adhesion</ins> is the amount that the tumor cells are sticking to the surrounding tissue. 

<ins>Single Epithelial Cell Size</ins> is the size of individual cells of the tumor. 

<ins>Bare Nuclei</ins> is the nuclei without cytoplasm that has accumulated in the tumor. 

<ins>Bland Chromatin</ins> is an evaluation of the tumor chromatin structure. 

<ins>Normal Nucleoli</ins> is whether there are nucleoli that look normal in the cells of the tumor. 

<ins>Mitoses</ins> is how often the cells are going through mitoses. 

<ins>Class</ins>  is tumor diagnosis, where 2 is used for benign and 4 for malignant.
